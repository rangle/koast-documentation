Koast is a thin server that provides a 'backend in a box'.  It allows a dev team to very quickly setup a backend with Authentication and a RESTful API for exchanging data with the server.

Koast supports social auth such as Google & Facebook.

The MongoDB database system is supported and uses Mongoose models to enforce types and validation contraints.
